# Weekly Summary
> You can write your weekly summary here, or you can upload a `pdf`, or whatever documentation to your assignment repository. Upload or push whatever changes (scripts, pictures, 3d models, etc.) to your assignment repository. Take a look at the [Hello World Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get started with Github. Read the [Markdown Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you decided to summarize your weekly progress in every `README.md`
