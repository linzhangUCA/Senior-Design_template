# Weekly Summary
Gavin and Dr. Zhang met on Wed. to discuss the workflow and what the project will look like. Daniel was recovering from his surgery and had to miss :(
Gavin took the DonkeyCar home and read up on its documentation at https://docs.donkeycar.com. He and Daniel need to coordinate before next week to figure out which feature team Trojan Donkey wants to implement. Zhang suggested autopilot (https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/train_autopilot/).

# Next Week's Goals
Gavin and Daniel need to write a plan for which feature to implement with the DonkeyCar this semester and how to go about doing so: dividing up the work and documentation and making a soft timeline to try to follow throughout the semester.
Aiming to have this done before the group meeting on Friday (9/3).
